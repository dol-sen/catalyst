# edit the following 2 paths to point to your catalyst git checkout if necessary
# then in a terminal window you wish to run the git code in...
# cd ~/catalyst
# source ./testpath
# edit a config catalyst.conf file. Make similar path changes for it to
# find and use/run the git checkout code.
# The catalyst code can then be run on a system without being installed or
# replacing an existing catalyst install which may be used for production.
#
# then run catalyst from there
#  eg:
#
# catalyst -c catalyst.conf -p -f stage1.spec
